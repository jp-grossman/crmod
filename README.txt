Build with visual studio, or run make.bat from the command line.

The build script expects progs.dat and userdefs.cfg to live in the parent directory.
If you don't already have your own userdefs.cfg, then copy utils/crmake/userdefs.cfg to
the parent directory.  You do *not* need to have a progs.dat in the parent directory before
building; this file will be generated by the build.
